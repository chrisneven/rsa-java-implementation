# RSA Java implementation

This document is intended as a manual for the two jar files required by the assignment criteria. For this assignment we have applied our knowledge of encryption and decoding messages in order to develop two programs in jar format. The two programs are a message encoder given a product of RSA keys, and a decoder given a message and a public key. We have been provided by our teacher with a product of RSA keys and a message for encoding, and an encoded message to decode with a public key. 


## INSTRUCTIONS FOR TESTING

For this assignment we’ve developed two jars which are an encoder application and a decoder application. In this chapter you’ll find instructions on how to try this these applications yourself.

Encoder.jar

1. Open terminal
2. Navigate into the same directory as the jar files
3. Instructions commandline: 
```
java -jar encoder.jar n e m. 
```
Example n, e and m values you could use, you can find in the previous chapter. Make sure you put the message value(m) you want to encrypt in between quotation marks.

4. Press enter to run the application.

Decoder.jar

1. Open terminal
2. Navigate into the same directory as the jar files
3. Instructions commandline: 
```
java -jar decoder.jar n e c. 
```
Example n, e and c values you could use, you can find in the previous chapter.

4. Press enter to run the application
